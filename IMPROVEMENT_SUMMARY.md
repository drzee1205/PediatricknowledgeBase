- **API_DOCUMENTATION.md**: Complete API documentation with medical endpoint specifications, authentication, and usage examples
- **DEPLOYMENT.md**: Production deployment guide with HIPAA compliance checklist and security configurations

### 🔒 Security & Compliance Implementation
- **HIPAA Compliance**: Implemented comprehensive security service (`src/lib/security.ts`) with:
  - Audit logging for all medical interactions
  - PHI (Protected Health Information) detection and masking
  - Input validation and sanitization
  - Data encryption for sensitive information
  - Rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **Security Middleware**: Global middleware (`middleware.ts`) protecting all API routes with:
  - Content validation and XSS prevention
  - Security headers (HSTS, CSP, X-Frame-Options)
  - CORS handling for secure API access
  - Request logging and monitoring
- **Enhanced API Security**: Updated RAG chat endpoint with comprehensive security measures and audit logging

### 🧪 Testing Framework
- **Jest Configuration**: Complete testing setup with medical-specific requirements:
  - `jest.config.js`: Main Jest configuration with coverage thresholds
  - `jest.setup.js`: Test environment setup with medical data mocking
  - `jest.env.js`: Environment configuration for testing
- **Medical Calculation Tests**: Comprehensive tests for pediatric drug dosing calculations (`src/__tests__/medical-calculations.test.ts`)
- **Security Tests**: Validation of security middleware and compliance features (`src/__tests__/security.test.ts`)
- **Test Scripts**: Added comprehensive npm scripts for testing including:
  - `test`: Run all tests
  - `test:watch`: Watch mode for development
  - `test:coverage`: Generate coverage reports
  - `test:medical`: Medical-specific test suite
  - `test:security`: Security-focused tests
  - `compliance:check`: Combined security, linting, and type checking

### 🏗️ Code Quality Improvements
- **Package.json**: Updated project name from generic scaffold to "nelson-gpt-pediatric-knowledge-base"
- **Dependencies**: Added missing Jest testing dependencies
- **Type Safety**: Enhanced TypeScript configuration for medical application requirements
- **Code Standards**: Established medical coding standards and validation processes
