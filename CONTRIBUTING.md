## üîí Security & Compliance

### Sensitive Information
**NEVER include in contributions:**
- Real patient data (PHI)
- API keys or credentials
- Internal medical facility information
- Personally identifiable information

### HIPAA Compliance
All contributors must understand:
- Data protection requirements
- Audit logging necessity
- Access control importance
- Incident reporting procedures

## üìö Medical Content Guidelines

### Clinical Decision Support
When contributing clinical tools:
1. **Validation**: Cross-reference with multiple authoritative sources
2. **Age Appropriateness**: Ensure pediatric-specific calculations
3. **Safety Checks**: Include appropriate warnings and contraindications
4. **Dosing Accuracy**: Double-check all medication dosing formulas

### Educational Content
Medical education contributions should:
- Target appropriate audience level
- Include learning objectives
- Provide practical clinical examples
- Reference current medical literature

## üß™ Testing Requirements

### Medical Algorithm Testing
```javascript
describe('Pediatric Drug Dosing', () => {
  test('calculates acetaminophen dose correctly', () => {
    const dose = calculateAcetaminophenDose(20, 'kg'); // 20kg patient
    expect(dose.min).toBe(200); // 10mg/kg minimum
    expect(dose.max).toBe(300); // 15mg/kg maximum
    expect(dose.frequency).toBe('every 4-6 hours');
  });

  test('enforces maximum daily dose', () => {
    const dose = calculateAcetaminophenDose(100, 'kg'); // Large patient
    expect(dose.maxDaily).toBe(4000); // Adult maximum
  });
});
```

### AI Pipeline Testing
```javascript
describe('RAG Medical Pipeline', () => {
  test('retrieves relevant pediatric content', async () => {
    const query = 'febrile seizure management';
    const result = await ragPipeline.execute(query);
    
    expect(result.sources).toContain('Nelson Textbook');
    expect(result.confidence).toBeGreaterThan(0.8);
    expect(result.answer).toContain('febrile seizure');
  });
});
```
